# Synthetic-Data-Generation
This project aims to generate synthetic data emulating patient profiles, health metrics, medical histories, emotional states, involvement in medical research, and associated ethical dilemmas. Utilizing advanced algorithms and statistical techniques, we aim to produce data that maintains the statistical properties of real-world healthcare data without compromising individual privacy.

# Features:
Patient Profiles Generator: Generates fake patient profiles with attributes like name, age, gender, ethnicity, location, smoking status, alcohol consumption, and exercise frequency.

Medical History & Metrics Generator: Produces synthetic past medical histories, surgeries, medications, allergies, and current health metrics like heart rate, blood pressure, and more.

Emotional Data Generator: Creates entries reflecting patients' emotional states over time, including mood ratings and feedback.

Research Participation Generator: Simulates patient involvement in various medical research studies.

Ethical Dilemmas Generator: Emulates potential ethical scenarios tied to specific patient profiles.

# Use Cases:
Research: Enables researchers to conduct preliminary analyses without access to real, sensitive patient data.

Development & Testing: Allows developers to test new healthcare software or tools using realistic data sets.

Training: Serves as a resource for training machine learning models without the risk of using genuine patient data.

# Privacy:
All data generated by this project is synthetic and doesn't correspond to real individuals. It's designed to mimic the structure and statistical properties of genuine healthcare data without any ties to actual patients.
